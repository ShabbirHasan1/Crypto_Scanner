# Crypto_Scanner
 A web app to scan crypto markets based on candlestick pattern recognition from "Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques: A Contemporary Guide to the Ancient Investment Techniques of the Far East"
 
 Inspired by Part-time Larry's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhvQN_yIgCo&list=PLvzuUVysUFOvZM6toPGOjG5oC_Qb0qGEL&index=2, I created this project to capture recognize candlestick patterns in crypto markets.
